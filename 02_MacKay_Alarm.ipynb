    "Taken from Chapter 21 of the late David MacKay's classic book, [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/book.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example 21.1. Fred lives in Los Angeles and commutes 60 miles to work. Whilst at work, he receives a phone-call from his neighbour saying that Fred’s burglar alarm is ringing. What is the probability that there was a burglar in his house today? While driving home to investigate, Fred hears on the radio that there was a small earthquake that day near his home. ‘Oh’, he says, feeling relieved, ‘it was probably the earthquake that set off the alarm’. What is the probability that there was a burglar in his house? (After Pearl, 1988).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let’s introduce variables b (a burglar was present in Fred’s house today), a (the alarm is ringing), p (Fred receives a phonecall from the neighbour reporting the alarm), e (a small earthquake took place today near Fred’s house), and r (the radio report of earthquake is heard by Fred). \n"

    "Note how counter-intuitive these inferences may be. Prior probabilities of burglary and earthquake are the same. However, alarm sensitivities to the two events are very different. One may expect earthquakes to be \"unlikely\" explanations, but above we saw that the chances of burglary are approximately even. \n",

    "Here, in the absence of information about the earthquake, the explanation lies in the high \"false positive\" $f$ (prior probability of alarm being triggered *regardless of anything*). In particular, it is comparable with the burglary rate. So the changes are even between burglary and an earthquake-independent false alarm. So, earthquakes are essentially irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be verified as follows. We leave the \"false positive\" probability $f$ symbolic, and study varying it from 0 (never) to 10<sup>-2</sup> (far higher than burglaries). No further changes required. In fact, we should have probably made the whole calculation symbolic in the first place."
